# 🧑‍💻 Frontend Assignment – Job Portal Dashboard

🔗 **Live Demo:** [coderound.vercel.app](https://coderound.vercel.app/)

## 📋 Overview

This is a modern Job Portal Dashboard built with **React** using **Vite**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, animated with **Framer Motion**, and structured using **React Router DOM**. I also utilized **React Icons** for consistent and appealing UI icons.

### ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Job Search** by title, company, tech stack, and location  
- 🎯 **Filters** for part-time, full-time, and remote roles  
- 👤 **Profile Section** with editable:
  - Profile photo
  - Name
  - Email
  - LinkedIn URL
  - Resume URL
  - Password
- 💡 **Modern, responsive design** with minimal and accessible UI
- 🎨 **Subtle animations** and visual polish using Framer Motion

My goal while building this was to create an intuitive end-to-end user experience that's not only visually pleasing but also responsive and accessible across all screen sizes.
