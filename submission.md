Frontend Assignment â€“ Job Portal Dashboard

Overview

I built the entire project in React using the vite tool, and made use of TailwindCSS and reaxt-icons for the UI, framer-motion for the animations and react-router-dom for the entire routing of the project.

The website allows users to search for their desired job by their preferred job title, company, tech stack and location, further streamlining the search by using filters to filter out part-time, remote or even full-time roles. Users can check out their details in the profile section where they can edit and make changes to their profile photo, name, email, Linkedin URL, Resume URL and password.

My entire thought process while building this project was to make an end-to-end user experience with a modern, minimal but also visually appealing website with the help of subtle animations, colours and icons but keeping it very easy to use and accessible to everyone as I have tried to make it responsive to all screen sizes.
