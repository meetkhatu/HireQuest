# Frontend Assignment â€“ Job Portal Dashboard

**Live Demo:** [coderound.vercel.app](https://coderound.vercel.app/)

## Overview

This is a Job Portal built with **React** using **Vite**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, animated with **Framer Motion**, and structured using **React Router DOM**. I also utilized **React Icons** for consistent and appealing UI icons.

### Features

- **Job Search** by title, company, tech stack, and location  
- **Filters** for part-time, full-time, and remote roles  
- **Profile Section** is saved locally on the browser's local storage with editable:
  - Profile photo
  - Name
  - Email
  - LinkedIn URL
  - Resume URL
  - Password
- **Modern, responsive design** with minimal and accessible UI
- **Subtle animations** and visual polish using Framer Motion

My goal while building this was to create an intuitive end-to-end user experience that's not only visually pleasing but also responsive and tried to make it accessible across all screen sizes.
